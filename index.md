### Mark for Trip to Xinjiang 
Vast. Transparent. Crystal-Clear.<br>

The scenery reminds me of an anime character's words.<br>

(Actually, in Xinjiang, it is far more than 4 kilometers.)<br>

Go **all in** on resting, and go **all in** on striving.<br>
I love seeing the horizon untouched by human construction.<br>
The horizon is not an old scar; it is a gap to breathe.<br>
